### Concept Of This Project
<p>This is the first group project in ALX Sprint 2 course. In the project we are tasked create a dynamic data structure using LIFO (Last In First Out) which is a principle of stack and FIFO (First In First Out) which is a queue. Now in this project we will be using C language and the Monty Language to built the impliementat of the project. With the knowlegde gain using stack and queue in linked list we will have a structure that will allow us create a node, so in stact it is Last In First Out, so there will be one pointer called <b>Top</b> this top act as a guide that monitor the elements place in the stack and also the required space for the element to be placed to give the desired output. For the queue which is the First In First Out. This will also required a dynamic data structure. In the process we create a two pointers which are <b> Front and Rear</b> the will be used to insert element from the user at the back of the queue while the rtevired onces will be gotten from the front pointer</p>
